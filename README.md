- 👋 Hi, I’m Danica Boe and I'm a Data Scientist.
- 👀 I’m interested in biological research using technology, running down linux rabit holes, and creating a comprehensive list of software and systems used within the data world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PostgreSQL, VIM, AWS, REST API's and Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data projects using Tableau, API's, cloud databases, SQL and Python. 
- 📫 Reach me on Linkedin at www.linkedin.com/in/danica-boe
- 🎨 When I'm not coding, I am: painting, reading, playing soccer, dancing Zouk, visiting my CASA kiddo and spending time outdoors with friends.
